<!-- So even though this document was full of issues, it still loaded in the browser, 
  albeit not entirely as intended. This is because, as mentioned earlier, 
  web browsers will attempt to fix these issues as they get rendered to the DOM. 
  We don't want to rely on this because it's inconsistent across browsers, 
  and even across versions of the same browser.
